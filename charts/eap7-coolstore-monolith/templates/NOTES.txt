The Coolstore application has been installed.

However you need to specify the route that was automatically created by OpenShift for RH-SSO.

You must upgrade the Helm chart and replace the value of keycloak.url with the "keycloak" Route URL wit the /auth endpoint.

This should be similar to:

keycloak:
  url: https://keycloak-coolstore.apps.65c7d3b08ce499ca2f7a.hypershift.aws-2.ci.openshift.org/auth
